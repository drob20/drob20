### 🧠 **About Me**

I’m **drob20**, a U.S. Navy Sailor cybersecurity student passionate about **Blue Team operations**, **threat detection**, and **incident response**.  

My focus is on defensive security and SOC analysis — detecting, investigating, and mitigating cyber threats through log correlation, network monitoring, and hands-on simulation.  

To develop my skills, I’ve built a custom **SOC lab environment** on **Proxmox**, integrating tools like **Wazuh**, **pfSense**, and **Kali Linux** to recreate realistic blue-team workflows and adversary scenarios.  

I also sharpen my detection and analysis skills through **Capture the Flag (CTF)** events, threat-hunting exercises, and continuous professional development.

### 🧩 **Cyber Projects**

- [**Project CyberDefense**](https://github.com/drob20/project-cyberdefense) — My home SOC lab environment simulating enterprise Blue Team operations using pfSense, Wazuh, and Kali Linux for adversary simulation.  
- *(Future)* **Threat Hunting Playbook** — Documenting incident response workflows and detection rules developed within the lab.  
- *(Future)* **SOC Metrics Dashboard** — Visualizing alerts, log ingestion, and endpoint telemetry from Wazuh.
